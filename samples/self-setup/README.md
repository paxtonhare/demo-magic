# Self Setup Demo

This demo sets up a git environment before the demo begins so you can simulate working with an existing git repository. The demo deletes any old state before starting so it can be run multiple times without any manual setup or clean up.

You can call `./demo.sh --reset` to run the setup without launching the demo. This is useful for for double checking the setup without having to exit out of the demo.
